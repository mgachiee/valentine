                    Dear Jennifer,
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I would like to start my letter with my appreciation for your existence. 
                    It's really unexpected how our story began and how I saw you on graduation practice day. 
                    I didn't expect that we'd come this far and that my feelings would be reciprocated. 
                    Let us fill these empty bubbles with great and happy memories of us. 
                    I know you already know that I hate the following:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I hate waiting for late people. 
                    I am not the type of person to give their full effort to something. 
                    I don't like taking pictures. I don't communicate my feelings well. 
                    But if it's you, I'll do anything I hate for you. 
                    I'm willing to wait for you, to give my best shot for you, to take lots of pictures with you, and to do the best I can to communicate things with you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I will do anything I can to show you the love and care I have for you. 
                    You are more than enough. You don't have to change a thing about you. 
                    Just stay being you, being the most beautiful lady in and out.
                    This month of love, I would like to greet you a Happy Valentine's Day. 
                    And also, I am asking you if you can be my Valentine? not just this month or next year, but my Valentine for the rest of my life. 
                    I promise to give you the love and care you deserve. I love you, Jennifer.
                </p>
